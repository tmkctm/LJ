LJava is a logical engine written in java. It helps you bring Logic Programming to your code (as long as you can import LJ).

This idea came to me when I studied Prolog and Logical Programming.
I figured combining the ability of Logical Programming into OOP will be a nice
thing to have.

The engine has the same power that Prolog has but much more. To Learn more, see the code
or wait for the first version notes to come out.

Here's a link to a clojure rope using LJ as the logic engine.
You can see there a nice example on how LJ can help you even if you're not using JAVA:
