LJava will be a logical engine for Java programmers.

This idea came to me when I studied Prolog and Logical Programming.
I figured combining the ability of Logical Programming into OOP will be a nice
thing to have.

The engine has the same power that Prolog has but much more. To Learn more, see the code
or wait for the first version notes to come out.
